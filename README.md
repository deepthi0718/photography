## Overview
**Photography** is a front-end portfolio website showcasing a curated gallery of images. Built with **HTML, JavaScript, and JSON**, the project features visually engaging layouts and dynamic image loading.

3. **Static HTML Pages:** Includes `index.html` and `store.html` for homepage and gallery browsing.
4. **Flexible Layouts:** Structured with clean HTML/CSS for an appealing visual presentation.
